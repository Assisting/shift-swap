		<title>Future Plans</title>
		<p>In the future, we hope to add more shift-trade functionality (You can see the skeleton of the "Swap Shift" page, which will allow you to give a user one of your shifts in exchange for taking on of theirs). As you can see, there is a lot of UX work to do yet, which will be a big priority. Overall stability and security can also be improved.</p>
		<p>For Milestone 6 we also plan on allowing this to be run as a web applet accessible by any standard web browser. This will improve not only accessibility, but also overall speed of execution.</p>
