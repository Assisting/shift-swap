Discussed ideas for project. Connor had idea for bus-texting app, also looked up sms gateways that can be used on a pc for free.

Ken's idea was an app for shift management. The goal is to allow a firm with shift workers to schedule workers shifts, and alow the employees to swap.

 The goal is to allow a firm with shift workers to schedule workers shifts, and allow the employees to swap.

General idea: 
Manager inputs users shifts. Employees can then propose to swap, get rid of, or request a shift. Option to either have manager allow transactions to go through once both employees agree to trade, or require manager to sign off on the swap.

Functionality:
	- Should allow managers to schedule workers
	- Should allow workers to trade shifts based on a request-trade system
	- Should allow tabulation of other relevant information, related to shift work
	- Should be web based, but we may do a java implementation to start, depending on scope and available time, web access can later be added.
	- Should notify relevant parties of changes made to their shift, both worker and manager, if manager has not signed off on it.
	- Potential additions could be a group-chat system, hours worked logging, different types of shift (vacation, unpaid, etc).
	- Seriously intense additions: create a scheduling algorithm based on availability and time requested off.
